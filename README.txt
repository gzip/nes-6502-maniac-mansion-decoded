Maniac Mansion for the Nintendo Entertainment System uses a simple compression scheme for it's
graphics and layouts known as Run Length Encoding (RLE). The encoding makes it very difficult
to edit any of the layouts or graphics in the game.

This hack expands the ROM and decodes all of the encoded data to make it very easy to edit graphics
and layouts. The number of tiles for each room is also maximized to make room for new graphics.
A lot of space is freed up as a result which makes it easier to edit game objects and text as well.
As such, this hack can serve as a base for new hacks such as Maniac Mansion Uncensored.

The hack also includes the Maniac Mansion Mouse Hack and fixes a few glitches in the game:

- The glitched graphics in the room under the house are fixed
- The glitched coin box graphics in the arcade are fixed
- The leftover pennant object in Weird Ed's room is removed
- The leftover keypad object in the hallway is removed
- The fence mask is fixed in the starting screen so that the player is completely behind it
- The colors for the right-side gargoyle on the stairs are corrected
- The border color is fixed when selecting Michael on the character select screen
- The glitched graphics for the developer under the house are fixed
- The interactivity for the radioactive slime in the basement is restored

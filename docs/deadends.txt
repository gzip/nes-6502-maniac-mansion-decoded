Dead Ends

There are several dead ends in the game.

If you want to enter the house by the front door with the first character and ring the bell before opening the door you get thrown into prison and Ed closes the door again. Then the character with the key sits in prison and the other two cannot enter the house without the key.

If you pour the paint remover into the tray in the dark room, or give it to the man-eating plant, you'll get stuck since you can't make the door visible.

The only solution with Razor and Jeff is the record deal for green tentacle, but without a stamp this doesn't work. So if you play with Dave, Jeff, and Razor and forget to grab Ed's package then you will not be able to get the stamps and complete the game.

Ed kills whoever hands him his microwaved hamster.

If you give Syd or Razor's contract to Green Tentacle he will be so jealous that he will kill the player. You should only hand the record contract over to Green Tentacle if it was for HIS demo tape.

You need the envelope from the safe for endings requiring a contract (Syd/Razor's record or Wendy's script) so you will have to correctly handle the Man-eating Plant by first using the radioactive water on the plant (not the pot!) and then giving it Pepsi. Anything else will leave you stuck.

If one of the character dies and has important items with him, they're gone forever. Miscellaneous ways to die:

Put radioactive water from the swimming pool into the microwave.

Drain the pool water, put someone in pool, then refill it - glugg glugg!

Record the tentacle mating call on the cassette tape and then play it for Green Tentacle.
